HorizonAirwaysFinalProj
Ticketing system which uses struts2/hibernate. Im planning to migrate it to Spring tho.

Import the project to your workspace and check the persistence.xml file. Make sure it points to your db and the auth are set up correctly. I've included the db scripts to be used as test data to be found on src/java/resources folder.

development of horizon airways ticketing system moved here.

This version still lacks multiple passenger, connecting flights & elegant display of total price using js.
